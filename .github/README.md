## About
A simple site which lists all of your GitHub projects, and creates a dedicated homepage for each of your repos.<br>
Useful as an auto-generated fallback for all of your apps which don't yet have a dedicated website/landing page.

E.g.
- `[your-username].github.io` - List of all your projects
- `[your-username].github.io/[repo]` - Homepage for each repo

---

## Development

- Prerequisites: You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) an [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Get the code: `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/as93.git`
- Install dependencies: `cd as93 && npm i`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`

---

## Deployment
Fork the repo, and rename to your username (e.g. `octocat.github.io`).<br>
GitHub Actions will automatically build and publish the site to your `https://<your-username>.github.io` page.<br>

For manual deployment, follow the [Development](#development) instructions above, then run `yarn build` and upload the `dist/` to any CDN, static hosting provider or web server.

---

## Configuring
All user-related settings goes in the [`config.ts`](https://github.com/Lissy93/as93/blob/main/src/config.ts) file.
Add your username there, and optionally add any other details to augment repo listings with custom meta.
Other than that, the only other thing you need is a GitHub API key in `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var (to avoid being limited while fetching repos)
